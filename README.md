# Bank_customer_segment

In this repository I showed how to segment bank customers using K-means. Using this powerful algo I clustered bank customers so that they can improve their marketing. I also used the very popular elbow method to choose the no of cluster. Finally added PCA technique to drop some column which are no very essential and then polt them in 2D.

I provided the dataset and source code for this. All important noted are provided in the notebook. I also added some theory to show how the algorithrm works. I foumd that a model of 7 clusters is working great for the validation sets. So I kept it finally.
